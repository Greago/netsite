<p><font face="Bookman Old style" color="lime"> Some examples of the data communication devices include <i>Network interface cards(NIC), Modems and Codecs, hubs, bridges, repeaters, routers, gateways, switches and access points.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old style" color="lime">
	<p>
<u>Router</u>
<ul>
<li>A device that connects any number of LANs.</li>
<li>Uses standardized protocols to move packets efficiently to their destination.</li>
</li>More sophisticated than bridges, connecting networks of different types (for example, star and token ring)</li>
<li>Forwards data depending on the Network address (IP), not the Hardware (MAC) address.</li>
<li>Routers are the only one of these four devices that will allow you to share a single IP address among multiple network clients.</li>
<li>Resides on Layer 3 of the OSI model.</li>
</p>
<br>
<u>Hub</u>
<ul>
<li>An unintelligent network device that sends one signal to all of the stations connected to it.</li>
<li>All computers/devices are competing for attention because it takes the data that comes into a port and sends it out all the other ports in the hub.</li> 
<li>Traditionally, hubs are used for star topology networks, but they are often used with other configurations to make it easy to add and remove computers without bringing down the network.</li> 
<li>Resides on Layer 1 of the OSI model</li></ul>
<br>
<u>Switch</u>
<li>Split large networks into small segments, decreasing the number of users sharing the same network resources and bandwidth.</li> 
<li>Understands when two devices want to talk to each other, and gives them a switched connection.</li> 
<li>Helps prevent data collisions and reduces network congestion, increasing network performance.</li>
<li>Most home users get very little, if any, advantage from switches, even when sharing a broadband connection.</li>
<li>Resides on Layer 2 of the OSI model.</li>
<br></ul>

<u>Additional Network Hardware Devices</u>
<br>
<br>
<i>Network Interface Cards (NICs)</i>
Puts the data into packets and transmits packet onto the network.
May be wired or wireless.
<i>Gateway</i>
Connects networks with different protocols like TCP/IP network. 
Routers and Gateways often refer to the same device.
<i>Proxy server</i>
Isolates inter0nal network computers from the internet. 
The user first access the proxy server and the proxy server accesses the internet and retrieves the requested web page or document. The user then gets a copy of that page from the proxy server.
